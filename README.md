The files here support research work done on the following manuscript: Assessing interannual variability in nitrogen sourcing and retention through hybrid Bayesian watershed modeling

There are two items in this repository: 

1)	RStaninputdata.rds- This is a R data file that needs to be used to run the model code. It needs to be imported into R with the appropriate command.  

2)	RStancode.R- RStan code needed to run the code. In addition, you will need to use the "model" function with the RStaninput dataset. 
RStan needs to be installed correctly first into R or (R Studio) and both the “rstan” and “rstudioapi” packages ar required. In future years, this compatibility might be different.
